Ever wanted to know how wealthy or deprived an area in England is?

Area checker allows you to search by postcode to find the levels of deprivation within the local authority area, represented in a 1-10 decile scale (higher is less deprived). 

The data is sourced from the English indices of Deprivation, which is a set of data collected for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.
